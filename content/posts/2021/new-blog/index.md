## Built with Hugo

{{< /style >}}

I've moved away from Wordpress as it was getting bloated, complicated to manage and expensive to host. I wanted something that was

* fast
* easy to use
* cheap to host
* source controlled

I can now write blog posts in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) in [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and then push my changes to GitHub which lets me have a history, I can edit from anywhere by pulling and pushing from any machine, even my phone.

I have moved my old blog posts from [here](https://sabin.io/blog/author/Mark%20Allison) into this blog.

I'm using the awesome [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator, which generates the site from some template html and content contained in markdown files. I push this to my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/markallisongit/blog) and the website gets rebuilt on the fly using [netlify's](https://www.netlify.com/) CI/CD pipeline.

## Benefits

* Focus on content, and I can be online or offline (say on train or plane)
* The entire site is source controlled in [GitHub](https://github.com/markallisongit/blog)
* It's blazing fast because it's statically generated
* Cheap to host (i.e. free) because it's completely static
